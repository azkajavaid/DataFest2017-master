### Expedia Dataset Analysis

Expedia Data was analyzed to assess users' personal attributes followed by user grouping in distinctive hotel clusters. Users were classified by attributes in solo, couple, family and group categories followed by a visual mapping of user flights. Individual attributes were used to predict the type of preferred hotel cluster (categorizations created based on hotel price and popularity) through machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees.
